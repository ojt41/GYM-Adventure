Long walkthrough:

This is a simple text based game in scala. You are a intermediate gym goer and your objective is to get to 100 kg max on the main exercises, namely: benchpress, squat, and deadlift. You start with 70kg maximum record on all the exercises. 


On starting the game, you will see a small introduction and will be prompted to enter the weight of your player. Enter a valid integer.

After that, the current stats of your player will be displayed. You can access these stats at any point by typing 'stats'. The list of full commands is accessed by typing 'help'

Then you may or may not decide to "talk" with the NPC. 

If you talk to the NPC, you can follow the instructions and buy the steroids. After buying you check your inventory to find steroids inside. Now you are able to use them. After using the steroids, you can check your stats to find that your record, as well as you likelihood of getting injured have increased.

You can also go straight to the exercise areas by typing "go" followed by the name of the place. Once you are there you can either type "train" or "stretch" followed by the exercise name. You do the exercise until you reach 100 kg max while having low likelihood of injury by stretching once in a while. Now go back to the lockerroom and go to the other exercise areas and follow the same steps.

The game ends when you either reach 100 kg max on all exercises (WIN case) or you use too much steroids (more than twice) in which case you will lose.
